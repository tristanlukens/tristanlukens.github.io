# tristanlukens.github.io

My website, built with SvelteKit, TailwindCSS and TypeScript.

Also using the SvelteMarkdown package and the Typography plugin for Tailwind.

## Todo

-   rethink the order in which the posts are; now, I have to create a new post ABOVE the last one and I have to manually edit the rest of the indexes in all posts (I think)
-   redo the blog (and portfolio in the future) to use a cms, and api and slugs
-   create the portfolio page
-   create the settings page

### Bugs

-   when you rotate the screen, the menu doesnâ€™t collapse but it does look bad since the nav has flex-row
-   service worker error
